What the project does
  This project allows users to utilize android studio by running a android emulator, automatically opening a empty layout view with a prompt to enter
  their name.  After user has entered their name and has clicked the enter button displayed in the layout under their name.  The "Hello World" prompt near the top margin
  of the layout changes to the text that they entered in the prompt.
Why the project is useful
  Allows users to understand the concept of user input and connecting different controls such as a textview control, button, and entry text prompt all working together to
  achieve the end result of displaying text entered by the user.
How users can get started with the project
  Open the "MainActivity.kt" file located within the "app" folder under "kotlin+java" --> "edu.temple.HelloWorld" in Android Studio project view panel.  There users can see
  what is occuring during the run process of the program.

  Also Reccomend opening the "activity_main.xml" file located under the "res" folder under "layout" in the project view panel.  Users can see a visual representation of the
  design being ran on the emulator including specifications and codes of each control and their attributes such as button, textview, etc.
